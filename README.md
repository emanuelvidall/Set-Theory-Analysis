# Set-Theory-Analysis
## About The Project ðŸ“š

This project was proposed by the teacher of Computational Mathematics course at University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR)
We've been requested to work with .csv file that included names, birthday dates, health status, public transportation usage, and more, to
divide into sets and make analysis based on that. We're verifying for intersections, exclusiveness, sets and generating a new set with the proposed
questions by the teacher.
We used Chart.js to work with sets more efficiently and automatically generate charts based on each set and intersection.
Development in collaboration with [Rafael Saboia](https://github.com/rafaelsaboia)

## Usage
Each chart is already parsing the data and showing its intersections
Click on "Gerar Lista" on each question to generate a list based on the question asked.
